## Functionality

The Bull Scalper EA is designed to perform scalping trades in bullish market conditions. It analyzes the market and places buy orders when the current price is higher than the previous price.

### Trading Parameters

The following trading parameters can be adjusted:

- `LOT_SIZE`: The lot size for each trade (default: 0.01)

### Initialization

If the current price is higher, the EA calculates the risk percentage based on the account equity and determines the position size. It then places a buy order using the `Buy()` function of the trading object and prints the trade details to the Experts tab.

### Trade Management

The `OnTrade()` function is called on trade events. It checks for open trades and if a stop loss hit occurs, it closes the trade using the `PositionClose()` function of the trading object. The trade details are printed to the Experts tab.
